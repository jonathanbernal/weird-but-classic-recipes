    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Arepas are an all-in-one filler. They are made of pre-cooked cornmeal, beans, salty cheese, platains, and beef.</p>
    <p>If you eat one, rest assured you will feel filled up for the rest of the day. That's how tasty and nutritious they are.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>A can of black beans</li>
        <li>About a pound of beef</li>
        <li>1 plantain</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        <li>Get ready to put your beef on a separate pan. Let it heat for a few minutes. If you add a few drops of water, you will know the pan is ready when the water makes an air bubble that bounces around.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add your beef to it. Cook for about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred your beef either by slicing it up in long, thin chunks or by using a shredder.</li>
        <li>Grab a can of black beans and heat it up on a pan for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you want to add plantains, you can slice them up at an angle and fry them up in oil until they turn golden.</li>
        <li>With the arepa now sliced up, you can fill it up with the shredded beef, beans, mozzarella cheese, and fried plantains.</li>
    </ol>
