# Recipe List

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a landing page for a list of recipes to practice my HTML/CSS skills as part of TheOdinProject's curriculum.

This page contains links to three recipes I like. Each page lists the ingredients as well as the steps to prepare each recipe.

You can preview the website by going to this [link](https://jonathanbernal.github.io/weird-but-classic-recipes/).
